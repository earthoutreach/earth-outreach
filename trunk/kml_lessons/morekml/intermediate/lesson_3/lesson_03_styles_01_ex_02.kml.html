<p>Here's a Point+Polygon multigeometry placemark with a Style. Create a Style Map and two different Styles for each state.<p>
<p>You want the normal state to have an icon, but no text label, and a thin, transparent yellow polygon outline (no fill).</p>
<p>The highlight state should have a bigger icon, show the text label, and the polygon should have thick, opaque outline, and a transparent blue fill</p>
