<p>This file illustrates some interesting properties of minLodPixels. Load it via a <code>NetworkLink</code> and note how the overlays are triggered at the <em>projected</em> screen sizes of regions which are much larger than the size of your physical screen (you don't have an 8192 px monitor, do you?).</p>
