    <headline>USGS Issues Landslide Alert for Hurricane Ernesto in Mountainous Eastern United States</headline>
    <description>Recent rainfall has soaked hillsides in the mountainous areas of the southeastern United States. In the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina and the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, 4.5 to 5.3 inches of rain has already occurred in the last several days before August 31, 2006. This preliminary rainfall soaking the soil and rock of hillsides can make these regions highly susceptible to landslides if major rainfall occurs when Hurricane or Tropical Storm Ernesto reaches these areas in the next couple of days, which is the predicted direction of the major rainfall of the continuing path of the hurricane. Rain is expected to persist throughout the central and northern Eastern United States beginning soon and continuing through this weekend. If the rainfall is intense, fast moving landslides, e.g. debris flows and rock falls, may be initiated. With less intense rainfall, but consistent heavy rain lasting for several days, more slowly moving landslides, such as earth slumps and block slides, are likely to initiate. Based on previous damaging hurricanes and heavy storms, parts of the mountainous Eastern United States, specifically Virginia, are particularly prone to landslides including the areas in the Appalachians and Blue Ridge Mountains. Such landslides can occur on hillsides that have slope as little as approximately 15 degrees. The combination of saturated soil and rock, heavy rainfall (perhaps the approximately maximum predicted 6.9 inches in 24 hours), could possibly trigger rapidly moving landslides from steep hillside slopes that contain weakened geologic materials.</description>

    <headline>Flash Flood Warning for North Central Los Angeles County in Southwest California</headline>
    <description>At 4:52 pm, Thursday, July 20,2006 the National Weather Service in Oxnard issued a Flash Flood Warning for North Central Los Angeles County in Southwest California.  This warning is in effect until 6:15 pm, and includes the Antelope Valley cities of Lancaster and Palmdale.  At 4:48 pm local law enforcement officials reported flash flooding between Highway 138 and Avenue K to the Kern County line.  Excessive runoff from heavy rainfall will cause flooding of small low water crossings, urban areas, highways, streets, underpasses and other drainage areas and low lying spots. </description>
    <instruction>Do not drive your vehicle into areas where the water covers the roadway.  The water depth may be too great to allow your car to cross safely.  Move to higher ground.  Residents or persons with interests near and especially downstream of the burned areas should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take protective action.

    <description>At 11:43 am, Thursday, July 20, 2006 the National Weather Service of San Diego issued a Flash Flood Watch.  Areas in, or below steep slopes in the Sawtooth and Millard Burn areas and are especially at risk and are the most susceptible to flash flooding, mud slides, rock slides and debris flows.  A flow of monsoon moisture into Southern California will continue to bring scattered showers and thunderstorms today.  Thunderstorms this afternoon and evening will have the potential to produce locally heavy rainfall rates of up to three quarters of an inch per hour. </description>

    <description>At 3:57 am, Thursday, July 20, 2006 the National Weather Service for Los Angeles and Oxnard, California issued a flash flood watch for the mountains of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties.  An influx of deep subtropical moisture into Southwestern California will cause an increasing chance of showers and thunderstorms today.  The chance of thunderstorms will be greatest this afternoon and evening across the Cuyama Valley, Antelope Valley and the Santa Barbara Mountains, Ventura and Los Angeles Counties excluding the Santa Monica Mountains.  The mid and upper level winds which will be steering any thunderstorms will be very weak.  Therefore thunderstorms and heavy showers could linger over any particular area for a while, producing heavy rainfall and a threat of flash flooding and debris flows.  The Perkins Burn Area is a recent fire that will be particularly vulnerable to flash flooding with debris flows should thunderstorms develop over that region this afternoon through this evening.</description>
    <instruction>Residents or persons with interests near and especially downstream of the burned areas should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take protective action should flash flood warnings be issued.  For more information on what to do if you live near a recently burned area, and more information on post-fire debris flow flows: http://landslides.usgs.gov/research/wildfire.  Campers, hikers and others spending time in the mountains should avoid narrow canyon areas that could flood rapidly in response to even distant thunderstorms.  Keep escape routes in mind and be prepared to climb to higher ground with little or no notice.  </instruction>

    <description>At 2:08 pm on Tuesday July 18, 2006 the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for portions of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties.  Of particular concern is the Perkins burn area in Santa Barbara County that would be prone to mud and debris flows if heavy showers develop over the region.  A moist, tropical airmass over the region today has produced the potential for thunderstorms with heavy downpours that could produce flash flooding.  This threat will develop as the afternoon progresses and will continue through the early evening hours until 8:00 pm.  Thunderstorms this afternoon and early evening have the potential for producing heavy downpours with flash flooding.  Flash flooding could result in flooded rural roadways and debris flows near and downstream of the Perkins burn area.  </description>
    <instruction>Residents or persons with interests near and especially downstream of the burned areas should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take protective action should flash flood warnings be issued.

    <headline>Flash Flood and Debris Flow Watch for Recently Burned Areas in Southern California</headline>
    <description>At 11:24 am PDT on Tuesday, July 18, 2006, the National Weather Service extended the Flash Flood and Debris Flow Watch for the Sawtooth and Millard burned areas until 9:00 pm PDT.  A flow of monsoonal moisture into southern California will bring favorable conditions for showers and thunderstorms.  Storms will have the potential to produce locally heavy rain and thus flash flooding and debris flows from the Sawtooth and Millard burn areas.  Locally heavy rainfall rates up to two thirds of an inch per hour will be possible. </description>
    <instruction>Residents or persons with interests near and especially downstream of the burned areas should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take protective action should flash flood warnings be issued.

    <description>At 2:08 pm PDT on Monday, July 17, 2006, the National Weather Service issued a Flash Flood and Debris Flow Watch for the Sawtooth and Millard burned areas, including portions of Apple and Lucerne Valleys, Coachella Valley and San Bernardino and Riverside County mountains.  The Watch remains in effect through Tuesday evening.  A flow of monsoonal moisture will continue into southern California through this week and will bring favorable conditions for showers and thunderstorms.  Storms will have the potential to produce locally heavy rain and thus flash flooding and debris flows from the Sawtooth and Millard burn areas.  Locally heavy rainfall rates up to two thirds of an inch per hour will be possible. </description>

    <description>At 6:02 am PST on Monday May 22, 2006 the flash flood watch for the recently burned areas in Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles Counties was cancelled.    The bulk of the heavy showers and isolated thunderstorms have moved to the east of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties.  There will still be a chance of showers through the afternoon but rainfall rates will be well below the rainfall thresholds for flash floods and debris flows from recently burned areas. </description>

WILL EXPIRE AT 2 PM PDT THIS AFTERNOON.

SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EARLY
EVENING HOURS. SOME SHOWERS MAY PRODUCE BRIEF HEAVY RAIN.
HOWEVER...THE SHOWERS ARE MOVING RAPIDLY EAST AND ANY HEAVY RAIN
THAT DOES FALL IS NOT EXPECTED TO LINGER OVER ANY ONE AREA FOR
MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES. AS A RESULT...BURN AREA MUD AND DEBRIS
FLOWS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED.</description>

    <headline>Landslide Alert for San Francisco Bay Area, California</headline>
    <description>Description: Recent almost continuous rainfall has soaked hillsides in the San Francisco Bay area making them highly susceptible to landslides. Large slow-moving landslides have already recently occurred in San Mateo and Marin Counties. Rain is expected to continue throughout this week and more slow moving landslides are expected to initiate and start moving during the next several weeks even after the rain stops. Parts of the Bay Area particularly prone to landslides include the areas in or near the Santa Cruz Mountains, Mount Tamalpais and the East Bay hills.  Such landslides can occur on hillsides that slope as little as 5-8 degrees. Heavy rainfall, perhaps 5 inches in 24 hours, could also trigger rapidly moving debris flows from steep slopes.</description>

    <headline>Flash Flood and Debris Flow Warning for the Harvard Burned Area in Southern California</headline>
    <description>At 1:42 am PST on Wednesday, March 29, the National Weather Service issued a Warning for flash flood and debris-flow activity from the Harvard burned area above Burbank, Central Los Angeles County, California.  NWS Doppler radar indicated heavy showers moving into the Harvard burned area.  Automated rain gages reported more than one third of an inch of rain in one half hour.  Rainfall at these rates will likely result in flash floods and debris flows in and below the Harvard burned area.  The Warning is in effect until 2:45 am PST. </description>
    <instruction>If you are in the warning area, move immediately to higher ground.  Residents living along streams and creeks should take immediate precautions to protect life and property.  Do not attempt to cross swiftly flowing waters or waters of unknown depth by foot or by automobile.

    <headline>Flash Flood and Debris Flow Watch for Recently Burned Areas in Southern Californi</headline>
    <description>At 2:35 am PST on Friday, March 10, the National Weather Service issued a Watch for flash flood and debris-flow activity from recently burned areas of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties.  These include the School Canyon, Topanga, Harvard, Piru, Simi, and Foothill Fires.  There was the potential for brief heavy rain along with isolated thunderstorms.  Rainfall intensities could exceed USGS thresholds, especially for the 2005 burned areas.  The Watch was allowed to expire on 5:46 pm PST on Saturday, March 11.</description>

    <headline>Flash Flood and Debris Flow Warning for the Harvard Burned Area in Southern California</headline>
    <description>At 8:00 am PST on Friday, March 3, the National Weather Service issued a Warning for flash flood and debris-flow activity from the Harvard burned area above Burbank, Central Los Angeles County, California.  At 7:55 NWS Doppler radar indicated heavy showers over the Hollywood Hills moving northeast at approximately 30 mph.  Rainfall rates with these showers exceed one half inch per hour.  Based on thresholds provided by the USGS, these rainfall rates are sufficient to trigger flash flooding and debris flows in and below the recently burned area.  These showers will be in the vicinity of the Harvard burned area by 8:15am.    The Warning is in effect until 10:00am.</description>

    <headline>Flash Flood and Debris Flow Outlook for Sierra Fire</headline>
    <description>Watersheds burned by the Sierra Fire in Orange County are susceptible to flash floods and debris flows during rainstorms.  Drainageways in Featherly Regional Park, stream crossings on State Highways 91 and 241 and Gypsum Canyon Road, and Santiago Reservoir could be impacted by these events.  A short period of moderate rainfall on the burned watersheds can lead to flash floods and debris flows.  Rainfall that is normally absorbed by vegetation can run off almost instantly.  This causes creeks and drainage areas to flood much sooner during a storm, and with more water than is normal.    In addition, the soils in a burn scar are highly erodible so flood waters can contain significant amounts of ash, mud, boulders, and vegetation.  Within the burned area and downstream, the powerful force of rushing water, soil, and rock can destroy culverts, bridges, roadways, and structures, and can cause injury or death if care is not taken.</description>

    <description>Date:  Sunday, January 29, 2006, 1:00 p.m., PST

The U.S. Geological Survey advises that wet soil conditions and continuing rainfall are likely to result in additional landslides during the next several days. Given the wet soil conditions, landslides are highly probable during intense rainfall or when rainfall amounts exceed 1.5 inches in 24 hours.  Steep coastal bluffs and other steep hillsides are particularly susceptible to landslides under present conditions.  

For more information about current conditions, see the following web pages:

    <description>The U.S. Geological Survey advises that wet soil conditions and continuing rainfall are likely to result in additional landslides during the next several days. Given the wet soil conditions, landslides are highly probable during intense rainfall or when rainfall amounts exceed one inch in 24 hours.  Steep coastal bluffs and other steep hillsides are particularly susceptible to landslides under present conditions.</description>
    <instruction>Advice for residents in affected areas: Before the storm (1) Become familiar with the land around you. Learn whether landslides have occurred in your area.  Slopes where landslides have occurred in the past are likely to experience them in the future. (2) Watch the patterns of storm-water drainage on slopes near your home, and note especially the places where runoff water converges, increasing flow over soil-covered slopes. Watch the hillsides around your home for any signs of land movement, such as small landslides or debris flows or progressively tilting trees. (3) Contact your local authorities to learn about the emergency-response and evacuation plans for your area and develop your own emergency plans for your family and business. During the storm: (1) Stay alert and stay awake. Many landslide fatalities occur when people are sleeping. Listen to a radio for warnings of intense rainfall. Be aware that intense short bursts of rain may be particularly dangerous, especially after longer periods of heavy rainfall and damp weather. (2) If you are in areas susceptible to landslides, consider leaving if it is safe to do so. Remember that driving during an intense storm can itself be hazardous. (3) Listen for any unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together. A trickle of flowing or falling mud or debris may precede larger flows. If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and for a change from clear to muddy water. Such changes may indicate landslide activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly. Don't delay. Save yourself, not your belongings. (4) Be especially alert when driving. Embankments along roadsides are particularly susceptible to landslides. Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of possible debris flows. Never drive across a flooded road.</instruction>

    <description>Between 3:16 am on Friday December 30, 2005 and 1:35 pm Monday January 2, 2006, the NWS issued Flash Flood Watches and Warnings for the recently burned areas in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles Counties.  Watches and Warnings were issued for the Gaviota, Topanga, Harvard, School Canyon, Gorman, Tovey, Pine, Crown Foothill, Piru, Simi, and Padua burned areas and indicated that these areas are susceptible to debris flows and flash floods.  The Watches and Warnings were based on comparison of predicted and measured rainfall amounts with rainfall thresholds provided by the USGS.  The final Flash Flood Watch was cancelled at 6:31 pm Monday January 2, 2006.
</description>
    <instruction>Flash Flood and debris flow watches mean that conditions may develop that lead to flash flooding and debris flows.  These are dangerous situations. You should monitor later forecasts and be prepared to take action should warnings be issued. Before a storm, avoid drainage areas near your home and places where runoff water converges increasing flow in channels. During a storm, if you are in an area that is susceptible to flooding or debris flow, consider leaving if it is safe to do so.  </instruction>

    <headline>National Weather Service issues Flash Flood Watches and Warnings for  Burned Areas in So. CA</headline>
    <description>Between 3:16 am on Friday December 30, 2005 and 1:35 pm Monday January 2, 2006, the NWS issued Flash Flood Watches and Warnings for the recently burned areas in Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles Counties.  Watches and Warnings were issued for the Gaviota, Topanga, Harvard, School Canyon, Gorman, Tovey, Pine, Crown Foothill, Piru, Simi, and Padua burned areas and indicated that these areas are susceptible to debris flows and flash floods.  The Watches and Warnings were based on comparison of predicted and measured rainfall amounts with rainfall thresholds provided by the USGS.  The final Flash Flood Watch was cancelled at 6:31 pm Monday January 2, 2006.</description>
    <instruction>What Can You Do If You Live Near A Recently Burned Area?
Before a Storm:
1.	Watch the patterns of storm-water drainage near your home, and note the places where runoff water converges, increasing flow in channels.  These are areas to avoid during a storm.
2.	Contact your local authorities to learn about the emergency-response and evacuation plans for your area.  Develop your own emergency plan for your family or business.

During a Storm:
1.	If you are in an area that is susceptible to flooding or debris flow (or has experienced flooding or debris flow in the past), consider leaving if it is safe to do so.  Remember that driving during heavy rainstorms can be hazardous.
2.	Stay alert and stay awake!  Many debris-flow and flash-flood fatalities occur when people are sleeping.  Listen to the radio for warnings of intense rainfall.  NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards tone alert will let you know of hazards in your area.  Be aware that intense bursts of rain may be particularly dangerous, especially after longer periods of heavy rainfall.
3.	If you are near a stream or a channel, listen for any unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together.  A trickle of flowing mud or debris may precede larger flows.  Be alert for any sudden increases or decreases in water flow and for a change from clear to muddy water.  Such changes may indicate debris-flow activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly.  Don't delay! Save yourself, not your belongings.  
4.	Keep in mind that during flash floods and debris flows water may rise much faster and much higher that it would if the watershed was not burned.
5.	Be particularly alert when driving.  Bridges may be washed out, and culverts overtopped.  Do not cross flooding streams!! Turn Around, Don't Drown ®!  Embankments along roadsides are particularly susceptible to landsliding.  Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of debris flow and flash floods.
