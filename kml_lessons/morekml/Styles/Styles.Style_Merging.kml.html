<p>There are two ways of styling data in KML: globally and locally. (In this sense, "local" means local to the feature.)</p>
<p>A global style must have an XML id and can be referred to from any feature's &lt;styleUrl&gt;. A local style does not necessarily need an id and applies only to the feature in which it is contained.</p>
<p>The rules regarding inheritance, overriding and merging are given by example in this file.</p>
